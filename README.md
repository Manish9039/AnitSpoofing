# AntiSpoofing
This project is a computer vision-based liveliness detector that distinguishes between real human faces and fake ones (e.g., images, videos, or masks) using deep learning. The system leverages face detection, blurriness assessment, dataset collection, model training, and real-time inference to classify inputs as "real" or "fake."
